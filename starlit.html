      <div>
        <div class="case-text">

                <p><em>Starlit Adventures</em>, developed by Rockhead Games, is a vertical-scrolling platform adventure game with simple mechanics and a strong focus on a younger audience.</p>

                <p>The game delivers an accessible and engaging experience and is available across multiple platforms, including mobile, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

                <p>This project began when I reached out to Epopeia, a Brazilian publisher with whom I have a strong professional relationship. At the time, Epopeia held a partnership with AirConsole and was responsible for most AirConsole porting projects in Brazil.</p>

                <p>Due to their teams being fully allocated, they decided to bring the project to Oak3 Game Studio.</p>

                <p>Our goal was to adapt a game that had already proven successful on other platforms to reach a new audience, exploring the unique context and constraints of the AirConsole platform.</p>

      <h3 class="case-section-heading">PROJECT CONTEXT</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
            <p>After Epopeia hired <strong>Oak3 Game Studio</strong> as an external partner for the porting of <em>Starlit Adventures</em>, a structured workflow was established to keep the project organized and predictable.</p>

            <p>This was also <strong>the first porting project Oak3 had ever worked on</strong>, which made the experience both challenging and formative for the studio.</p>

            <p>Before diving deeper into the workflow, it’s important to briefly explain the platform involved.</p>

            <p><strong>AirConsole</strong> is an online gaming platform that turns smartphones into controllers using a simple session code.</p>

            <p>Players can play directly on their TV without any additional hardware.</p>

            <p>AirConsole also maintains partnerships with automotive companies, such as <strong>BMW</strong>, allowing games to run directly inside vehicles.</p>

            <p>For the <em>Starlit</em> project, <strong>Epopeia acted as the Product Owner</strong>, defining the main guidelines based on their previous experience with other AirConsole porting projects.</p>

            <p>Between Epopeia and Oak3, there was a third company, <strong>Sorora</strong>, also working on behalf of Epopeia, acting as an intermediary manager.</p>

            <p>Representing Oak3, I received the guidelines from Epopeia, discussed scope, complexity, and deadlines with Sorora, and then organized the team internally to deliver what was agreed upon.</p>

            <p>At the end of each sprint, our work was reviewed by Sorora. Once approved, it was sent to Epopeia for final quality validation before being delivered to AirConsole.</p>

            <p>This workflow remained consistent throughout <strong>six months of development</strong>, with all direct communication with AirConsole handled by Epopeia.</p>

      <h3 class="case-section-heading">MY ROLE</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
            <p>Working with multiple companies is always challenging, as each one brings its own culture and processes.</p>

            <p>Bringing three different companies into the same project made clear communication absolutely critical.</p>

            <p>As the <strong>Porting Lead</strong> on Oak3’s side, one of my main responsibilities was to keep communication clear, aligned, and transparent, ensuring that no misunderstandings would escalate into technical or relationship issues.</p>

            <p>With a six-month timeline, multiple stakeholders involved, and a WebGL target platform, which is often unpredictable, maintaining stability and alignment was a constant effort.</p>

            <p>This was also <strong>Oak3’s first porting project</strong>, which required extra caution when estimating scope and deadlines.</p>

            <p>As a lead, I carefully planned deliveries to ensure the team could work safely and sustainably, avoiding unnecessary pressure or technical debt.</p>

            <p>Although <em>Starlit</em> was originally a mobile game and relatively lightweight, it had not been designed for the AirConsole ecosystem.</p>

            <p>When moving to WebGL, several incompatibilities surfaced.</p>

            <p>The biggest challenge of the project was the port itself, adapting game flows and reworking mechanics to function reliably on the web platform.</p>

            <p>I was closely involved in these decisions and frequently worked side by side with the programmer to solve technical issues as they emerged.</p>

            <p>Another major challenge was the <strong>multiplayer system</strong>.</p>

            <p>Multiplayer is complex by nature, and in this case, the existing implementation was not compatible with AirConsole’s SDK.</p>

            <p>We had to rethink and adapt the game’s multiplayer design to align with the platform’s architecture while preserving the original experience.</p>

            <p>After a long six-month journey filled with technical challenges and constant coordination, the game was successfully released on AirConsole.</p>

            <p>The collaboration between <strong>Epopeia, Sorora, and Oak3</strong> proved successful and continued through additional projects.</p>

    <!-- MULTIPLAYER CHALLENGES -->
    <section id="project-context" class="case-section case-fullwidth">
      <h3 class="case-section-heading">APPROACH & DECISION-MAKING</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
          <p>I started the porting process by gathering all the technical requirements needed for the game to run properly on the new platform. This included build size limits, target framerate, supported devices, and general platform constraints. I followed the same process when analyzing the AirConsole SDK.</p>

          <p>With the requirements mapped, we moved into the practical phase. The first step was switching the project to WebGL and observing how it behaved. As expected, the project did not run on the first attempt.</p>

          <p>After understanding how the game reacted to the platform change, I mapped all the issues caused by the WebGL migration and identified which ones were critical for the game to function. I then classified these problems by priority.</p>

          <p>High-priority issues were those that prevented the game from running.</p>

          <p>Medium-priority issues blocked the game flow.</p>

          <p>Low-priority issues included visual glitches or unusual behaviors that did not directly impact gameplay.</p>

          <p>The early phase of the porting followed this cycle: fixing issues, discovering new ones, and constantly re-evaluating priorities.</p>

          <p>Once we reached a build where the full game flow was functional, I reviewed the project again to identify remaining risks and improvements. At this stage, we also had clear technical goals that needed to be met, such as reducing build size and optimizing assets to ensure stable performance across devices.</p>

          <p>Because the game needed to run on TVs and inside cars, the target hardware was significantly more limited than smartphones or consoles. This required careful optimization decisions and trade-offs.</p>

          <p>This became a key decision point in the project. We had a playable version that completed a full game loop, but there were still critical porting requirements to address. We chose to prioritize platform stability and performance over short-term completeness.</p>

          <p>We followed this approach until the fourth month of development. During this period, in addition to optimization, we implemented the AirConsole SDK and adapted the game to support the platform’s specific features.</p>

          <p>In parallel with the core porting work, another part of the team focused on UX adjustments for AirConsole. This included designing and developing a mobile-based controller interface, from visual layout to JavaScript implementation. At the same time, the art team created new assets tailored for the platform.</p>

          <p>Designing the mobile controller interface was another interesting challenge. Treating a smartphone as a full game controller is not something done every day. Since the phone’s grip and ergonomics are very different from a traditional controller, we spent considerable time exploring layouts and interactions that felt comfortable and intuitive.</p>

          <p>By the fifth month, all major technical requirements had been met. At this stage, we focused on lower-priority issues and refinements, addressing minor bugs and visual glitches while preparing the project for final delivery.</p>

          <p>The final month was dedicated entirely to QA and polishing, ensuring stability, consistency, and a smooth experience across all supported devices.</p>

      <h3 class="case-section-heading">REFLECTION</h3>

        <div class="case-text">
            <p>Working on <em>Starlit Adventures</em> was a very different experience within my journey at Oak3.</p>

            <p>Leading a porting project for a non-traditional platform was challenging, but also extremely rewarding. I faced situations and decisions that simply do not exist in a standard game development pipeline.</p>

            <p>The project pushed me to deepen my understanding of optimization, platform constraints, and low-level project configuration details. This experience directly influenced the way I approach game design today, making me more aware of technical limitations from the earliest design stages.</p>

            <p>Collaborating with professionals from different companies and cultures was another major learning opportunity. Working closely with industry veterans from Epopeia on an almost daily basis helped me mature my understanding of production pipelines and gain a clearer perspective on how larger, more established games are structured and delivered.</p>

            <p>Facing the challenge of leading a porting project, something entirely new both for me and for Oak3, within a relatively tight schedule became a turning point in my career.</p>

            <p>Despite the complexity of the project, Oak3, under my leadership, successfully met all deadlines and platform requirements.</p>

            <p>The team remained highly engaged throughout the process and genuinely enjoyed working on the project. Just as importantly, a strong chemistry was built between Oak3, Sorora, and Epopeia, resulting in a lasting partnership and further collaborations.</p>

            <p>Overall, <em>Starlit Adventures</em> was a demanding but transformative experience that significantly shaped my growth as a game designer and technical lead.</p>
