          <p>
            <strong>Time Brasil Gameplay</strong> is a mobile gaming platform built around a collection of mini games inspired by Olympic sports and the Brazilian national team.
          </p>

          <p>
            Developed by <strong>Hermit Crab</strong>, the platform was created in partnership with the
            <strong>Brazilian Olympic Committee</strong> to promote Brazilian athletes during the Olympic Games.
          </p>

          <p>
            Players can compete in different sports-themed mini games, earn points, unlock skins, and engage
            with a shared progression system, similar to platforms like <em>Roblox</em> or <em>Fortnite</em>,
            but fully focused on Olympic disciplines and Brazilian identity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Oak3 Game Studio collaborated on the project by designing and developing three mini games within
            this ecosystem, following the platform’s technical, visual, and gameplay guidelines.

      <h3 class="case-section-heading">PROJECT CONTEXT</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
            <p>
              The project began when one of my partners and I reached out to <strong>Hermit Crab</strong> after
              hearing they were working on a larger initiative involving multiple mini games.
            </p>

            <p>
              We scheduled a conversation with <strong>Matheus</strong>, their CEO, presented Oak3’s previous
              work, and shared our interest in contributing to the project.
            </p>

            <p>
              The conversation flowed naturally, and Hermit Crab saw value in bringing Oak3 into the development
              process. As a starting point, we agreed that Oak3 would design and develop
              <strong>three mini games</strong>, allowing them to evaluate both the structure of their mini-game
              platform and our collaboration within it.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the time, Hermit Crab was developing a <strong>mobile platform of mini games</strong> in
              partnership with the <strong>Brazilian Olympic Committee</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The goal was to promote Brazilian athletes during the Olympic Games through interactive
              experiences. Players could engage with different Olympic sports, earn points, unlock skins, and
              progress through the platform, following a structure similar to games like
              <em>Roblox</em> or <em>Fortnite</em>, but fully centered on Olympic disciplines and the Brazilian
              national team.

    <!-- PRODUCTION SETUP -->
    <section id="idea-conception" class="case-section case-fullwidth">
      <h3 class="case-section-heading">PRODUCTION SETUP</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
            <p>
              The production was structured around a <strong>two-week pipeline per mini game</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Each cycle consisted of <strong>one week of development</strong> followed by
              <strong>one week dedicated to QA and polishing</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The only exception was the first mini game, which included an additional onboarding week focused
              on understanding the <strong>shared project architecture</strong> and the
              <strong>asset creation guidelines</strong> defined by Hermit Crab.
            </p>

            <p>
              This structure was essential to maintain consistency across the platform while working under
              tight deadlines and allowing multiple teams to collaborate effectively.
            </p>

            <p>
              From Hermit Crab’s side, the project was supported by a <strong>Producer</strong>, along with
              <strong>leads in programming, game design, and art direction</strong>, who provided guidance,
              feedback, and validation throughout development.
            </p>

            <p>
              This ensured that all mini games followed the same technical standards, visual identity, and
              gameplay principles across the platform.
            </p>

            <p>
              On Oak3’s side, the core team consisted of <strong>myself as Game Designer</strong>, a
              <strong>Producer</strong>, an <strong>Artist</strong>, and a <strong>Programmer</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, one of my former partners supported the project acting as <strong>QA</strong>,
              helping validate gameplay mechanics and design decisions during development.
            </p>

            <p>
              This setup allowed us to move quickly while staying aligned with the platform’s technical
              constraints, shared architecture, and overall creative direction.

    <!-- MY ROLE -->
    <section id="project-context" class="case-section case-fullwidth">
      <h3 class="case-section-heading">MY ROLE</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
            <p>
              On this project, I worked as a <strong>Game Designer</strong>, acting as the bridge between
              concept, technical feasibility, and implementation within a very tight production schedule.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the first two mini games, Hermit Crab provided the initial concepts and a set of guidelines
              that needed to be followed. While there was room to suggest adjustments and improvements, the main
              goal was to respect the proposed direction and adapt it to our production constraints and platform
              limitations.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first mini game was based on <strong>cycling</strong>, designed as a bike endless runner.
            </p>

            <p>
              The second focused on <strong>archery</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the third mini game, Oak3 was given <strong>full creative freedom</strong>, and we proposed an
              <strong>obstacle racing game</strong> inspired by classic Olympic-style mini games.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the initial mini games, my role involved reviewing the concepts and guidelines, discussing
              feasibility and scope with the programmer, and translating those ideas into mechanics that could
              be safely developed within the two-week pipeline.
            </p>

            <p>
              Based on the progress of the first mini game, I worked closely with my partner and our producer to
              identify ways to streamline development and reduce risk for the following cycles.
            </p>

            <p>
              While the second mini game was in development, I began designing the third one from scratch. Given
              the tight schedule and our growing familiarity with the platform, we deliberately chose a concept
              that allowed us to <strong>reuse systems and knowledge</strong> from the previous mini games while
              still offering a distinct experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              Classic references like <em>Mario</em> and <em>Sonic</em> Olympic mini games strongly influenced
              this decision.
            </p>

            <p>
              My design approach throughout the project was straightforward: respect the proposed concepts,
              adapt them to our constraints, and focus on making each mini game
              <strong>simple, responsive, and fun</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              During development, I worked closely with the team on gameplay feel, balance, and polish, adding
              juiciness where possible to elevate the experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite the short scope typical of mini games, this process required constant decision-making to
              balance ambition and feasibility.
            </p>

            <p>
              The result was a set of mini games that were easy to pick up, enjoyable to play, and well received
              by the Hermit Crab team.

    <!-- REFLECTION -->
    <section id="project-context" class="case-section case-fullwidth">
      <h3 class="case-section-heading">REFLECTION</h3>

        <div class="case-text">

        <p>
          Developing <em>Time Brasil Gameplay</em> was a very different experience from what we were used to
          at Oak3.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not only because of the tight scope and the need for fast, precise decisions, but mainly because
          this project was not about building a standalone game.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, it required designing <strong>well-defined mini games</strong> that needed to fit
          seamlessly into a larger platform with pre-established rules and directions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hermit Crab’s team was always open and supportive, providing guidance whenever needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since Oak3 was the <strong>first external studio</strong> to develop mini games for the platform,
          we also faced situations where documentation was still incomplete or certain decisions had not yet
          been fully defined.
        </p>

        <p>
          While this occasionally slowed down development, it never affected the quality of collaboration,
          and the relationship between the teams remained very positive throughout the project.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working closely with an experienced game designer from Hermit Crab, who regularly reviewed my
          work, was another major learning opportunity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having direct feedback from someone with deep industry experience helped me grow significantly and
          refine my design decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was a genuine pleasure to collaborate with one of the leading game studios in Brazil.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the end, Hermit Crab decided to temporarily pause the project after evaluating that the platform
          was not yet ready for a full commercial release.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result, most of the mini games developed during this phase are not publicly available.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite that, the project was a valuable experience that strengthened my ability to design within
          constraints, collaborate across studios, and contribute effectively to larger production
          ecosystems.
