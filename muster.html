      <h3 class="case-section-heading">CONTEXT & VISION</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
              <p>
                Muster was conceived during a moment of uncertainty in the tech industry
                regarding remote work.
              </p>
              <p>
                While many companies were fully embracing distributed teams, highlighting
                increased productivity and healthier work-life balance, there were also
                growing reports of isolation, disconnection, and weakened team relationships.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, Oak3 was at a mature stage, with a well-structured team and
                strong technical foundations. We had recently worked on a third-person
                multiplayer product, gaining valuable experience with shared virtual spaces,
                presence, and real-time interaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this context in mind, I brought forward the vision for Muster to my
                partners. I believed it was the right moment to explore a product that could
                address the social and collaborative gaps of remote work through a gamified,
                spatial experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                I presented the core principles of the product and proposed approaching it as
                a long-term initiative, supported by an investor who could contribute not
                only financially, but also strategically.
              </p>
              <p>
                The idea resonated with the team, and we decided to move forward. By building
                on the technical background and knowledge gained from previous projects, and
                by securing a strategic partner, we were able to reduce risk while exploring
                a new product-driven direction.

    <!-- MY ROLE -->
    <section id="idea-conception" class="case-section case-fullwidth">
      <h3 class="case-section-heading">MY ROLE</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
            <p>
              On Muster, I worked as <strong>Lead Game Designer</strong>,
              <strong>Product Owner</strong>, and closely collaborated as
              <strong>Producer</strong> throughout the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was the first project where I formally acted as a design lead. Instead
              of working alongside another game designer as peers, I was responsible for
              supervising the design process, reviewing work, identifying improvements,
              and guiding design decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of the core ideas and solutions originated from my vision, which I then
              directed another game designer to explore and detail. From there, I reviewed,
              refined, and challenged those designs to ensure consistency and quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              In parallel, I was responsible for planning the product from start to finish.
              This included defining milestones, presenting the roadmap to the investor,
              and producing regular progress reports.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whenever the project required a shift in direction or scope, I reassessed the
              plan, justified the changes, and realigned expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              During day-to-day development, I shared production responsibilities with the
              studio’s producer. Even when I was not acting directly in that role, I
              remained deeply involved in discussions around prioritization, scope, and
              decision-making to keep the project aligned with its goals.

    <!-- DESIGNING A SHARED SPACE -->
    <section id="project-context" class="case-section case-fullwidth">
      <h3 class="case-section-heading">DESIGNING A SHARED SPACE</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
              <p>
                I have worked remotely for many years and across different companies. While
                working from home brings clear benefits, over time I started to feel the
                absence of real, spontaneous interaction with colleagues.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most remote tools reduce people to icons in a list, creating an invisible
                barrier to conversation and turning the work environment into something cold
                and rigid.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I founded Oak3, one of the first alternatives we explored was Gather, a
                pixel-art virtual space where teams could build a shared office. Simply
                having an avatar and moving through a virtual environment brought back a
                sense of physical presence that I had not felt in remote work for a long
                time.
              </p>
              <p>
                We used Gather from the very beginning, but over time its limitations became
                clear. That discomfort led me to research the market and talk with different
                companies, where I identified recurring pain points related to isolation,
                lack of presence, and friction in spontaneous communication.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the first design decisions for Muster was to create a 3D shared space
                with a more professional tone, reinforcing that this was a work environment
                rather than a playful abstraction.
              </p>
              <p>
                The perspective was intentionally kept consistent, allowing users to always
                understand where others were and what was happening around them. This
                spatial legibility helps users decide when and how to interact, without
                requiring explicit prompts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each user has their own desk, and interactions are communicated through
                simple visual cues, such as avatars gathering together or conversation
                indicators appearing above them.
              </p>
              <p>
                These signals were designed to act as implicit rules, teaching users how to
                behave in the space without tutorials or instructions. Presence,
                availability, and focus are communicated visually, not verbally.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additional layers, such as personal status indicators and optional private
                spaces, were designed to give users control over their level of social
                exposure.
              </p>
              <p>
                The broader space was structured to support different social contexts.
                Meeting rooms, shared areas like a kitchen, and informal spaces encourage
                movement and create situations similar to real-world office dynamics.
              </p>
              <p>
                This approach works because it builds on behaviors people already understand
                from physical offices. Instead of forcing users to learn new interaction
                patterns, Muster recreates familiar social dynamics in a virtual
                environment.

        <!-- SYSTEMS BEHIND THE SPACE -->
    <section id="project-context" class="case-section case-fullwidth">
      <h3 class="case-section-heading">SYSTEMS BEHIND THE SPACE</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
              <p>
                In traditional offices, much of team dynamics is understood through informal
                signals. Managers and teammates naturally perceive who is isolated, who is
                overloaded, or who has suddenly changed behavior.
              </p>
              <p>
                In remote work, most of these signals disappear, leaving teams with little
                context beyond meetings and task completion.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of Muster’s core design goals was to recover these signals without
                introducing invasive or controlling systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of focusing on individual productivity, the platform was designed to
                observe interaction patterns and spatial behavior at a high level,
                transforming everyday actions into readable signals about team dynamics.
              </p>
              <p>
                Behind the scenes, Muster aggregates information such as presence, movement,
                interaction frequency, and shared spaces usage to reveal trends over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The intent is not to monitor individuals, but to help teams and leaders
                understand how collaboration is unfolding and when intervention or support
                might be needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Optional self-reported mood indicators further add context, allowing human
                conversations to happen earlier and more naturally.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another key system layer was reducing cognitive overload. Remote work often
                forces people to juggle multiple tools simultaneously, fragmenting attention
                and breaking flow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Muster was designed as a central workspace where essential tools can coexist
                within the same environment, minimizing context switching and keeping users
                focused on collaboration rather than navigation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, performance and lightness were treated as design principles. The
                platform needed to feel present without becoming heavy or intrusive.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every system decision was guided by the idea that Muster should support daily
                work quietly in the background, enhancing awareness and connection without
                competing for attention.

    <section id="project-context" class="case-section case-fullwidth">
      <h3 class="case-section-heading">REFLECTION</h3>

        <div class="case-text">
              <p>
                Muster was the largest and most ambitious product I have worked on so far.
                Developed over more than a year, it involved close collaboration with the
                entire studio and required aligning game design thinking with broader,
                corporate-scale systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Designing a product that borrows from game design principles while remaining
                accessible to a non-gamer audience was one of the project’s main challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finding the balance between expressiveness, usability, and simplicity
                demanded constant iteration and careful decision-making.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because it was a long and complex project, maintaining team motivation and
                engagement was also a significant responsibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond technical challenges, this required clear direction, realistic
                planning, and continuous communication to keep everyone aligned with the
                product’s goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout Muster’s development, I stepped fully into the role of Lead Game
                Designer, guiding design decisions, supporting the team, and ensuring
                coherence between vision and execution.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although this role was new to me, it became one of the most valuable learning
                experiences of my career.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project successfully reached its planned milestone, delivering a
                functional MVP now in the hands of the investor.
              </p>
              <p>
                More importantly, Muster reinforced my ability to lead design at scale,
                navigate ambiguity, and build complex systems that prioritize human
                interaction and clarity.
