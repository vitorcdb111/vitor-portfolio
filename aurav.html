          <p>
          An innovative solution to transform the local commerce and marketing experience. It consists of a highly customizable, AI-powered interactive avatar designed to assist, guide, and enrich the purchasing and decision-making process for the public. It features an advanced administrative panel with chatbot support, providing more precise and efficient information exchange, and allowing for the collection of interaction data in compliance with the LGPD (Brazilian General Data Protection Law), which is converted into detailed reports. These insights help companies better understand their audience's needs, making it a powerful resource for business planning and strategies.

     <!-- DESIGNING THE AURA EXPERIENCE -->

      <h3 class="case-section-heading">DESIGNING THE AURA EXPERIENCE</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
          <p>
            When we started developing Aura in 2023, the main challenge was defining how
            users would interact with an interactive avatar in a
            <strong>simple and natural way</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            At that time, AI technologies were still evolving, and conversational systems
            did not yet offer the speed and flexibility they have today.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most obvious answer was voice interaction.
          </p>

          <p>
            But that simple idea raised an important question:
            <strong>how can talking to an avatar actually feel easy?</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Behind a single voice interaction, there are multiple technical constraints
            that directly impact user experience, such as response time, interpretation
            accuracy, feedback clarity, and operational cost.
          </p>

          <p>
            All of these factors needed to be carefully balanced to ensure the interaction
            felt responsive and reliable, without making the product impractical to
            operate.
          </p>

          <p>
            Working closely with a programmer, we explored different solutions for voice
            input, AI interpretation, and text-to-speech responses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since conversational AI tools were still limited at the time, performance and
            speed became critical UX concerns.
          </p>

          <p>
            The interaction needed to feel immediate, otherwise users would quickly lose
            confidence or assume the system was not working.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once we reached a stable solution, the next step was validation.
          </p>

          <p>
            We tested Aura in live events to observe how non-technical users interacted
            with the avatar.
          </p>

          <p>
            These sessions revealed unexpected behaviors and usability issues, which
            guided multiple iterations focused on simplifying flows, reducing friction,
            and reinforcing feedback.
          </p>

          <p>
            One key usability principle guided my decisions throughout the project:
            <strong>users will always find the most complex path if given the chance</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            My role was to design interactions that prevent unnecessary complexity while
            making users feel confident, capable, and comfortable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Innovation can be intimidating, especially for non-technical audiences, so
            clarity, speed, and trust were essential.
          </p>

          <p>
            Aura’s experience evolved through continuous iteration and real-world testing,
            resulting in an interaction model that feels approachable, dynamic, and easy
            to use, even when powered by complex systems behind the scenes.

              Aura was developed in collaboration with another company responsible for the
              web-based management system.
            </p>

            <p>
              As the project evolved, I gradually took on additional responsibilities on the
              Unity side.
            </p>

            <p>
              This included contributing to new avatars, animation adjustments, usability
              improvements, and performance optimizations to ensure a consistent experience.
