        <h3 class="case-section-heading lgpd-hero-what-heading">WHAT IS THE PROJECT?</h3>

        <p>
        <em>LGPD Hero</em> is an educational game designed to teach Brazil’s General Data
        Protection Law (LGPD) playfully and engagingly, complementing corporate training
        programs.
        </p>

        <p>
        Set in the fictional universe of the Galactic Patrol, the game transforms legal
        principles into interactive experiences. Players learn by exploring, talking to
        characters, and interacting with the world across different missions.
        </p>
        <p>At its peak, the game reached an average of 500 monthly subscribers, with Clube de Regatas Flamengo as its main client.</p>

      <h3 class="case-section-heading">PROJECT CONTEXT</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
          <p>
            The idea for <em>LGPD Hero</em> started after Evoluto identified a major issue with LGPD
            compliance. Many companies were struggling to help their teams truly understand the law
            and its principles.
          </p>

          <p>
            To address this, we partnered with SecBrain, a company specializing in LGPD, to guide
            us on the key legal aspects while we focused on transforming that knowledge into an
            engaging interactive experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            We proposed a game-based training solution, something that could teach employees
            through play, using both direct and indirect learning, rich analogies, and
            story-driven interactions to make data protection fun and memorable.
          </p>

          <p>
            The biggest challenge was designing something that non-gamers could understand and
            enjoy. It couldn’t feel like a quiz. It needed to be simple, intuitive, and genuinely
            entertaining while still focused on the law’s core concepts.
          </p>

          <p>
            That’s when I proposed a third-person shooter, exactly the kind of idea that sticks in
            someone’s mind, especially an HR manager hearing about a “data protection shooter”.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course, I’m not completely crazy. The game is an automatic shooter, inspired by
            <em>Archero</em>. The player moves freely through the map, and when enemies get close,
            the system automatically fires. This approach allows players to focus on what really
            matters: completing missions and learning.

    <!-- IDEA CONCEPTION & UNIVERSE -->
    <section id="idea-conception" class="case-section case-fullwidth">
      <h3 class="case-section-heading">IDEA CONCEPTION</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
          <p>
            The hardest part of this project was, without a doubt, the law itself. The LGPD is
            dense and complex, not exactly the kind of material you’d expect to turn into a fun
            game.
          </p>

          <p>
            I needed a universe that could help me build analogies, a world that felt engaging and
            familiar while giving me creative freedom. After thinking for a while, I decided it
            would be a sci-fi game inspired by <em>Star Wars</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was the perfect fit. My target audience consists mostly of adults who grew up during
            the golden age of <em>Star Wars</em>. That connection alone would make the experience
            instantly nostalgic and approachable.
          </p>

          <p>
            The premise is:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              “The Cyber Galaxy, the final frontier. Guided by the principles of the General Data
              Protection Law (LGPD), the Galactic Patrol Academy stands as the guardian of the
              universe. Its mission is to maintain order and enforce the security laws that govern
              the digital world. These are the journeys of its patrol officers.”
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            Once I had the world, I began designing analogies between the law and the gameplay.
            The LGPD contains several key principles, and I wanted each of them to appear
            naturally as mechanics, items, or characters in the game.

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
          <p>
            I mapped several key LGPD concepts directly into the game’s world and systems so
            players could learn through interaction, not just text.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Data: the star of the LGPD</strong></p>
          <p>
            Data is represented by the <strong>Codex</strong>, an in-game item available in
            different colors, each representing a type of data. Every mission in the game revolves
            around protecting, recovering, or analyzing these Codexes.
          </p>

          <p><strong>The DPO (Data Protection Officer)</strong></p>
          <p>
            In the real world, the DPO teaches, guides, and ensures compliance. In the game, this
            became the <strong>Admiral</strong>, leader of the Galactic Patrol, who trains the
            player and ensures the law is respected across the galaxy.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Enemies</strong></p>
          <p>
            Most cyberattacks are executed by automated programs that break through security
            systems by testing multiple codes, essentially, bots. In <em>LGPD Hero</em>, these
            become combat droids, the main representation of hostile actors in the Cyber Galaxy.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Phishing</strong></p>
          <p>
            To teach social engineering, I introduced <strong>Hacked Droids</strong>, corrupted
            allies that look almost identical to friendly patrol droids. They visually communicate
            phishing: something that looks safe but is actually harmful.
          </p>

          <p><strong>The Verify Gun</strong></p>
          <p>
            The player’s main weapon is the <strong>Verify Gun</strong>, a reference to the
            processes of data analysis and integrity validation. When used, it interrupts enemy
            actions and forces them to drop data fragments, reinforcing the concept of protection
            through active verification.
          </p>

    <!-- COMMON DROIDS -->
    <section id="common-droids" class="case-section">
      <h3 class="case-section-heading">COMMON DROIDS</h3>

      <div class="case-two-column">
        <div class="case-text">
          <p>
            The most common enemy in the game, the Droid, was totally inspired by the B1 battle
            droids from <em>Star Wars</em>. I wanted this enemy to feel easy and almost comical,
            much like the original B1s.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, B1s are fragile, unintelligent, and often appear in
            large groups. That combination makes them both funny and harmless, and that’s exactly
            the feeling I wanted to recreate in <em>LGPD Hero</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our droids behave the same way: they appear in groups, they’re easy to defeat, and
            they exist to make the player feel confident and in control. However, while a single
            droid is weak, a group of them can quickly become overwhelming if the player ignores
            them.
          </p>

          <p>
            This balance creates a subtle tension: they’re not individually dangerous, but they
            demand attention and crowd management. The design intention was clear: this enemy
            isn’t meant to be threatening. It’s meant to keep the player alert and active,
            rewarding quick decision-making and spatial awareness.

    <section id="hacked-droids" class="case-section">

      <div class="case-two-column">
        <div class="case-text">
          <p>
            If the regular Droid is the simple, comic-relief enemy, the <strong>Hacked Droid</strong>
            is its opposite, designed to create moments of tension and act as a kind of mini-boss
            during gameplay.
          </p>

          <p>
            This enemy has more health and a more complex behavior pattern. Once it detects the
            player’s presence, it immediately begins to attack.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unlike the common Droids, Hacked Droids don’t appear in groups. Instead, they’re
            strategically placed to surprise the player.
          </p>

          <p>
            The key point is that their appearance is almost identical to the regular patrol Droids
            from the Galactic Patrol. This visual similarity forces players to pay attention and
            identify the enemy before engaging, teaching the concept of phishing indirectly through
            gameplay.
          </p>

          <p>
            In terms of combat behavior, the Hacked Droid charges at the player with a tackle
            attack. After this move, it becomes temporarily disoriented, giving players a brief
            window to react, reposition, or plan their next action. This design keeps the encounter
            dynamic, mixing small bursts of panic with short moments of relief and strategy.

            When the player begins a level, they receive a main mission and a short lore
            introduction, along with new insights into LGPD principles. After that, the player is
            free to explore the map at their own pace.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>LGPD Hero</em> was designed as a training tool for real DPOs (Data Protection
            Officers) to help them evaluate how engaged their teams are during the learning
            process. To support this goal, I created a score and reporting system that tracks not
            only the player’s success but also how they interact with the educational content.
          </p>

          <p>
            To reach the victory condition, the player simply needs to complete the main mission.
            However, throughout the level, players can earn additional points for performing various
            actions that reinforce LGPD concepts:
          </p>

          <ul class="case-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Defeating enemies:</strong> each enemy defeated grants points and drops a
              data fragment, reinforcing the idea of data protection. Collecting these fragments is
              optional but contributes to the final score.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Recovering dropped items:</strong> when the player dies, they drop a bag
              containing their personal data. Recovering it references another LGPD principle and
              also rewards the player with points.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exploration and interaction:</strong> computers and NPCs across the level
              provide gameplay tips and information about LGPD. Each interaction grants points,
              encouraging curiosity and engagement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Completing side quests:</strong> finishing all secondary objectives in a
              mission rewards the player with a special badge and bonus points, recognizing deeper
              exploration and mastery.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            All actions are tracked on the backend and recorded in a final report for the DPO. This
            allows trainers to see not only who completed the mission, but also how each player
            behaved, whether they explored, interacted, or simply rushed to the end.
          </p>

          <p>
            To promote ongoing participation, <em>LGPD Hero</em> features an in-game leaderboard
            accessible to all players. It displays team rankings and monthly scores, creating
            friendly competition and motivating employees to replay missions and improve their
            results.

            layout and logic of the HUD, defining where and how each element would appear on screen
            to improve clarity and maintain immersion.
          </p>

          <p>
            I focused on flow and spatial logic, making sure players could easily understand their
            status, objectives, and resources without distraction or confusion.
          </p>

          <p>
            To clarify, I was responsible for the experience design, screen flow, positioning, and
            player readability, while the final art and visual polish were created by the art team.
          </p>

          <p>
            The result was a clean and accessible interface that supported player learning and
            focus without overwhelming the screen, aligning perfectly with the game’s educational
            purpose.

            As Project Manager, I was responsible for planning all milestones and deliverables
            throughout the project. I regularly reported progress to our partners and clearly
            explained each development phase to ensure full alignment between the production team
            and stakeholders.
          </p>

          <p>
            During development, we used Jira as our main tool for task tracking and monitoring,
            following the Scrum methodology. We conducted regular planning meetings and daily
            stand-ups to keep communication active and transparent.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the start of the project, we worked in one-week sprints, which helped us stay agile
            and react quickly to changes. As the project and team matured, we shifted to a
            two-week sprint cycle, allowing for deeper iteration and more structured progress.
          </p>

          <p>
            We adopted a strict rule: a task was only considered “done” once it had been tested and
            validated. We defined clear milestones to mark tangible progress and maintain a steady
            production rhythm.
          </p>

          <p>
            Given the complexity of <em>LGPD Hero</em>, I planned an early milestone dedicated to a
            playable short version, which we used to validate the concept with the target audience.
          </p>

          <p>
            After gathering feedback, I led a team retrospective to reorganize priorities and
            adjust our development roadmap. This approach allowed us to refine gameplay and improve
            educational clarity before full production, ensuring the project met both design and
            training goals.
