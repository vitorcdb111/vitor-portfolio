        <p>
        <em>Crazy MX</em> is a fast-paced motocross stunt game developed for the CrazyGames platform.
        </p>
        <p>
        It’s all about physics, speed, and chaos, a small, energetic game built for quick sessions and endless replayability.
        </p>
         <p>
        The project began when I reached out to CrazyGames’ business team to propose a partnership.
        </p>
        <p>
        They liked Oak3’s pitch and came back with a collaboration idea: they’d provide a base asset and a list of requirements, and we’d be responsible for turning it into a real, playable game.
        </p>
         <p>
        It was a short timeline, clear goals, and a challenge.
        </p>
        <p>Upon release, the game spent several weeks featured on CrazyGames’ front page and was warmly received by players.</p>

    <!-- DESIGN PROCESS -->
    <section id="project-context" class="case-section case-fullwidth">
      <h3 class="case-section-heading">DESIGN PROCESS</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
            <p>The development process was straightforward but fast-paced.</p>

            <p>After receiving the asset, I ran full tests to understand its mechanics and limitations.</p>

            <p>I also worked with our programmer to do a quick technical pass, mapping what could realistically be changed.</p>

            <p>Once we had a clear understanding of the asset, I created a short design brief summarizing what could be modified or expanded.</p>

            <p>From there, I built a Game Design Document that connected the client’s requirements with the asset’s technical boundaries.</p>

            <p>The template itself was well-made, but it was still just a framework.</p>

            <p>My job was to turn that framework into a complete game experience.</p>

            <p>Our first challenge was figuring out how to make the game feel good. We didn’t have time for big systems, so we focused on the small things that make a huge difference: feedback and feel.</p>

            <p>I led short sessions with the team to discuss ways to add juiciness. We added VFX, SFX, and a score system to create instant feedback loops.</p>

            <p>The score system was a good decision. It not only made the game more rewarding but also added competition and replayability, encouraging players to chase higher scores. Replayability in this context was good because the platform’s business model is based on playtime.</p>

            <p>At this stage, my main design focus was on expanding the core loop through power-ups and stunt mechanics.</p>

            <p>Each power-up had to feel unique but also feed into level design possibilities.</p>

            <p>One of the most impactful additions was the Magnetic Power-Up. It changed the entire rhythm of the game.</p>

            <p>Instead of simply jumping and doing endless tricks, players now had to control their motorcycle’s position carefully, balancing gravity and magnetism to avoid crashing. That small change brought tension, strategy, and variety.</p>

      <h3 class="case-section-heading">LEVEL DESIGN</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
            <p>Designing the levels was both the most fun and the hardest part of the project.</p>

            <p>Since our main audience was kids and teenagers, we had to find the right balance between challenge and accessibility.</p>

            <p>Each level introduced something new, whether a power-up, a loop, or a new obstacle. Building complexity gradually to keep players learning and smiling.</p>

            <p>Too hard, and they’d quit. Too easy, and they’d lose interest. Finding that balance was a challenge.</p>

            <p>Together with another level designer, we built 20 levels and a special endless mode.</p>

            <p>Our inspirations came from the 2D old Sonic games and the Trials Franchise.</p>

            <p>We borrowed <em>Sonic</em>’s fast-paced gameplay, filled with loops and jumps, then mixed them with <em>Trials</em>’s challenges. These created a mix of speed, skill, and chaos perfectly aligned with <em>Crazy MX</em>’s energetic identity.</p>

      <h3 class="case-section-heading">MULTIPLAYER CHALLENGES</h3>

      <div>
        <div class="case-text">
            <p>One of CrazyGames’ main requests was to include local multiplayer, and that quickly became one of the project’s biggest challenges.</p>

            <p>The asset had no multiplayer support, and time was short.</p>

            <p>After discussing options with our programmer, we decided to build a split-screen mode and keep collisions between players.</p>

            <p>That single choice changed everything.</p>

            <p>Because <em>Crazy MX</em> is all about physics and stunts, allowing players to crash into each other added a layer of comedy and unpredictability that perfectly fit the game’s personality.</p>

            <p>It turned what could’ve been a simple two-player mode into a chaotic, laugh-out-loud experience, and all it took was one smart, fast decision under pressure.</p>

      <h3 class="case-section-heading">REFLECTION</h3>

        <div class="case-text">
            <p>Crazy MX is one of my favorite games I’ve ever developed. Even today, it’s still fun to play.</p>

            <p>As a Game Designer, it gave me the opportunity to refine my understanding of pacing, game flow, and level design.</p>

            <p>The tight development schedule also pushed me to improve our production pipeline and overall organization.</p>

            <p>The game performed strongly on the platform, being highlighted soon after release, with an average score of 8.7 and solid player retention.</p>

            <p>Following its success, we went on to develop two more projects in partnership with Crazy Games.</p>
